# Particle events generator

This ROOT macro generates an arbitrary number of particle events, each consisting of 100 particle generations. Run `make root` to build the ROOT script. The ROOT prompt will open and everything will be ready to launch the generation. Type `generate(N_GEN, FILE_NAME)` in the prompt, replacing `N_GEN` with the desired number of events and `FILE_NAME` with the name of the ROOT file you would like to save the data in.
